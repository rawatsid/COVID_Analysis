## Preparing the dataset

Create a fork from [JHU's GitHub repository for the data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) which gets updated everyday. To get the latest data, one can pull latest changes whenever needed. This data is used in the data_preparation_US.R file to create state-wise weekly data.
